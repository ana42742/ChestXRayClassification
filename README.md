# CHEST XRAY SCAN CLASSIFICATION MODEL FOR COVID-19 USING DEEP LEARNING
I created a hybrid of the pre-trained CNN model VGG16 to best demonstrate transfer learning.
This classifier works on the COVID-19 Radiography dataset which contains labelled chest x-ray scans 
with the following labels: 
- Normal (around 10000 images)
- Viral Pneumonia (around 2000 images)
- Covid-19 (around 3000 images)

My model achieves an accuracy of 92.4%
